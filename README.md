This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict California housing prices using features like rooms, population, and proximity to the ocean. The pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as imputation, scaling, encoding, and feature engineering. Models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and others were trained and evaluated using cross-validation and ensemble methods, leading to improved predictions and better generalization across the dataset.
