This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California based on various features such as the number of rooms, bedrooms, population, households, income, and geographical location. The pipeline begins with data preprocessing, including handling missing values with median imputation, scaling numerical features, adding custom-engineered attributes (e.g., rooms per household, population per household), and encoding categorical variables like "ocean_proximity" using one-hot encoding.

The transformed data is then used to train models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, with evaluation performed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The Decision Tree model initially overfits, but techniques such as cross-validation and potentially ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forests or Gradient Boosting) can improve performance. The pipeline is structured using Scikit-learn's tools like `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` for easy integration and future model experimentation.
